			<p>These are just a few of the words that describe the top chef in the world. Gordon Ramsay is an internationally known British chef, restaurateur, writer, food critic, and television personality. You may have seen him on the British series <em>Hell's Kitchen</em> or the American series <em>Masterchef</em>. You may have even seen him as recently on the AT&T Wireless TV commercial showing off his culinary expertise in Costco.</p>
			<p>The man is everywhere. Some people see him as the blunt, aggressive food critic with borderline malicious comments. Is it the nature of the job, or is he exaggerating his media character? Others also see him as a tough teacher, yet kind soul. It is not hard to see this with some of his charity work and life with the family. Like his cooking, there are complex layers and flavors to the man.</p>
			<p>Whether you are looking for a restaurant recommendation, entertaining media quips, or want to learn more behind the fiery chef portrayed in media, this site has it all for you. Explore our sections and see what Ramsay has to offer</p>
