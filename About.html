		<h3 class="sub">WHO IS RAMSAY?</h3>
			<p>To understand how Ramsay ended up with such a reputation and international influence calls for a closer look into his life. Much of his technique, skills, and temperance come from his childhood and predecessors in fine dining. From start to finish, these are the essential ingredients that make up Gordon Ramsay.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph-1">
		<h3 class="sub">Preparing the Ingredients</h3>
			<p>Ramsay was born on Novemeber 8, 1966, in Johnsstone, Renfrewshire. Renfrewshire is part of the thirty-two council areas of Scotland and is located in the west central Lowlands of the UK, just outside Glasgow. He did not stay there long, because his family moved to Stratford-upon-Avon when he was five years old. Also known as Stratford, this market town is about ninety miles north west of London. It is a quaint suburbia yet old town and popular destination for Shakespeare fans.</p>
			<p>Much of his early life was "hopelessly itinerant" as Ramsay says because of his family constantly moving around. Most of it was due to the aspiration and failures of his violent, alcoholic father. Much of his childhood was marked by abuse and neglect that radiated not only to him, but to his mother and three siblings. As he grew up in Stratford, he worked fairly low end jobs to save up. For example, he was a pot washer at a local Indian restaurant. Once he had enough, at age 16, he moved out of the family home into a flat in Banbury.</p>
			<p>Cooking was not the first interest in Ramsay's childhood. It was actually soccer. As he grew up, he began playing and would join to play under-14 football for Warwickshire (his county) when he was 12. When he was 15, he joined the Glasgow Ranger, a pro club.</p>
			<p>The information on his time with the Ranger's is somewhat fuzzy with different accounts. Ramsay claimed to have played two first team games with them, which would be astonishing considering the high competitiveness in the sport and his young age. However, according to his autobiography, he only played a couple of non-league matches as a trialist and then trained with the team for a few months. Either way, his football career would be shortlived. Three years after signing on with the Rangers, he fatally injured his knee when he smashed the cartilage during training. The injury only worsened when he played a squash game and tore a crucial ligament. With an athletic career cut short, Ramsay had to look into other future alternatives.</p>

	<div class="paragraph-2">
		<h3 class="sub">Mixing it All Together</h3>
			<p>As he tried to leave behind his failed football past, Ramsay became more invested in his culinary education. He enrolled at North Oxfordhshire Technical College at 19 years old to study hotel management. He described his decision to enter catering college as "an accident, a complete accident." Well, turns out that wild turn to study the major would lead to success!</p>
			<p>After graduating with his degree in 1987, Ramsay worked as a commis chef -- a basic chef in the larger question -- at the Wroxton House Hotel. He began taking on many responsibilities, from running the kitchen to managing the 60-seat dining room. Unfortunately, his job there would turn sour due to the poor decision (who intiated we do not know) to have a sexual relationship with the owner's wife. After the ordeal, Ramsay moved to London and worked in various restaurants until he landed his break with the tempermental chef Marco Pierre White at Harveys.</p>
			<p>Marco Pierre White also has the same titles we have come to know Ramsay by: chef, restaurateur, television personality. He was dubbed the first celebrity chef of the UK restaurant scene and had racked up his own successes in Michelin star restaurants. Perhaps it is here Ramsay experienced his first taste with the harsher kitchen lifestyle. Ramsay only worked at Harveys for two years and ten months before declaring he as tired of "the rages and the bullying and violence".</p>
			<p>Leaving Harvey's behind, Ramsay decided he could further advance his career by studying French cuisine. White discouraged the rising chef from working in Paris and instead pushed him to work for Albert Roux at Le Gavroche in Mayfair. Albert Roux was also a reputable chef and a French restaurateur, so he could help train Ramsay in the cuisine he was looking for. He was also able to expand his connections by meeting Jean-Claude Breton who is actually the head host of his Gordon Ramsay Restaurant. After working under Roux for a year, the French chef invited Ramsay to work with him at Hotel Diva, a ski resort in the French Alps, as his second chef-in-command. Soon after Ramsay (now 23) finally moved to Paris to work with Michelin-star chefs Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon. Ramsay considered Guy Savoy to be his mentor.</p>
			<p>Ramsay stayed in France for about three years before succumbing to the physical and mental stress of the ktichen. He took a year off working as a personal chef on the private yacht <em>Idlewild</em> in Bermuda, and his boat advnetures would take him to Italy where he expanded his culinary training to include Italian cuisine.</p>

		<h3 class="sub">Placed Into the Oven</h3>
			<p>You may have noticed a lot of names thrown around in the previous sections. That is part of the chef life. You learn from current stars in the field and they influence you in the work you do as you attempt to put your twist on fine dining. At this point in time, Ramsay had a wide array of tools under his belt to take the next step in his cooking career. After his travels, he returned to London in 1993 and landed his first position as head chef under chef-patron Pierre Koffmann at the three-Michelin-starred La Tante Claire in Chelsea. La Tane Claire has since closed and was sold to Ramsay for his flagship restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.<p>
			<p>He did not stay under Koffmann long when Marco White reentered his life and offered to set him up with a head chef position and share in the Rossmore, a restaurant owned by White's business partners. Rossmore was renamed <em>Aubergine</em> and over the course of three years, he earned the establishment a two-star rating from Michelin. He also earned the award Newcomer of the Year at the prestigious Catey Awards, which is like the Oscars for restaurant and hotel businesses. Ramsay would soon butt interests with the business owners. The owners wanted Aubergine to become of chain while Ramsay wanted to run his own restaurant. He ended up leaving the partnership in July of 1998 and described the decision as "the most important day of my entire cooking career; the most important decision of my life". Ramsay was setting out to build a reputation of his own, free from the influence of other chefs and businesses.</p>
			<p>In that same year, Ramsay opened his first restaurant in Chelsea, <em>Restaurant Gordon Ramsay</em> with the help of his father-in-law and former colleagues. Hailed as a destination for high-end foodies, the restaurant achieved its three-star Michelin rating in 2001. Ramsay was the first Scot to achieve such a feat. His success would only blossom after.</p>

		<h3 class="sub">Watching the Dough Rise</h3>
			<p>Ramsay was on the rise. After the overwhelming success from his first restaurant, he opened several other restaurants, such as a second Gordon Ramsay in London and <em>Petrus</em> which serves modern French cuisine. He also began a couple establishments at the Dubai Creek and Connaught hotels. He soon would launch his restaurants internationally beginning with <em>Verre</em> in Dubai. <em>Gordon Ramsay</em> and <em>Cerise</em> opened in Tokyo in 2005.</p>
			<p>The man was everywhere. Ramsay would soon after open two establishments in the US at The London NYC in 2006. He won top newcomer in the city's coveted Zagat guide, though there were mixed reviews from professional critics.</p>
			<p>Ramsay would return to Europe in 2007 and open <em>Gordon Ramsay</em> in Ireland at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Although that restaurant closed in 2013, he still found success with several restaurants back in the US, in Los Angeles. He also opened his first Canadian restaurant in August 2011. The list could go on and on, but if you are interested in learning more, check out our R&R page on his famous restaurants and recipes.</p>

		<h3 class="sub">A Masterpiece</h3>
			<p>To many aspiring chefs, Ramsay seems to have it all. He has expanded his food empire and he is featured throughout the culinary world. Yet it is also important to note the personal side of Ramsay that also makes him the man he is, eespecially his family and charity work.</p>
			<p>Ramsay married Cayetana Elizabeth Hutcheson in 1996. Hutcheson was a Montessori-tarined schoolteacher. The couple divides their time between their homes in Wandsworth Common, London, and Los Angeles. They also have five children: Megan, Holly, Jack, Matilda, and Oscar. You may see his children pop up in his culinary Youtube videos or in his biographies.</p>
			<p>Gordon Ramsay and his family are also involved in various charitable events and organizaitons. He fulfilled his goal to finish 10 marathons in ten years. With a life revolved around food, it was a high priority for him to stay in shape! His last marathon was back in 2009 sponsoring the Scottish Spina Bifida Association. He has been a member of the association since 2004 and launched his "Buy a Brick" appeal to help raise funds for a new Family Support Center and Head Office in Glasgow. Much of his work is through fundraising, galas, and appeals.</p>
			<p>In 2005, Ramsay teamed up with notable Indian chef Madhur Jaffrey to aid Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), which is an international development charity group. They worked on the <em>Spice Up Your Life</em> event where raised money for VSO's work in HIV and AIDS in India. Ramsay and his wife were also the first couple to become ambassadors for the women's charity "Women's Aid" and ran the Flora Families marathon to support it.</p>
			<p>Ramsay often makes time to help out in other charity events. His reputation helps boost fundings for organizations and he harnesses that fame to do good. So while you may have an angry chef goading you on <em>Hell's Kitchen</em>, there is also a kinder man on the inside working to spread goodness.</p>

			<p>Along with his work in his television shows and media appearances, Ramsay has also written more than 20 books. Can you believe that? A majority of them are dedicated to his recipes meant to be shared with aspiring chefs and foodies like you.</p>
			<p>His many businesses have since consolidated into Gordon Ramsay Holdings Unlimited. He was also named Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2006, which is one of the highest honors. Similar to earning the purple heart, Queen Elizabeth bestowed this achievement to Ramsay to commemorate him for the local and national role he has int he hospitality industry. And while he may not have achieved stardom in the sports world, he still was inducted into the Culinary Hall of Fame in 2013.</p>
			<p>Ramsay certainly has not slowed down yet. He still has much to offer and has become an iconic legend internationally. Check back to stay tuned on his latest accomplishments and to see what he is up to next!</p>
